# DJT

DJT is the native utility token of Dijets. It’s a hard-capped, scarce asset that is used to
pay for fees, secure the platform through staking, provide a basic unit of account between
many diverse subnetworks created on Dijets. 

:::info

- `1 nDJT` is equal to `0.000000001 DJT`.

## Utility

DJT is a capped-supply (up to 100M) resource in the Dijets ecosystem that's used to power the
network. DJT is used to secure the ecosystem through staking and for day-to-day operations like
issuing transactions, and for use in its primary domain indices.

DJT represents the weight that each node has in network decisions. No single actor owns
the Dijets Network, so each validator in the network is given a proportional weight in the
network's decisions corresponding to the proportion of total stake that they own through proof
of stake (PoS).

Any entity trying to execute a transaction on Dijets pays a corresponding fee (commonly known as
"gas") to run it on the network. The fees used to execute a transaction on Dijets is burned,
or permanently removed from circulating supply.

## Tokenomics

A fixed amount of 100M DJT was minted at genesis, and a small amount of DJT is constantly minted
as a reward to validators. The protocol rewards validators for good behavior by minting them DJT
rewards at the end of their staking period. The minting process offsets the DJT burned by
transactions fees. While DJT is still far away from its supply cap, it will almost always remain an
inflationary asset.

Dijets does not take away any portion of a validator's already staked tokens (commonly known as
"slashing") for negligent/malicious staking periods, however this behavior is disincentivised as
validators who attempt to do harm to the network would expend their node's computing resources
for no reward.
