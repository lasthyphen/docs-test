Decypher 3.0 is the latest iteration of a web3 wallet built specifically to take full advantage of Dijets Utility Chain and its features.

Sending digital assets between chains is a straight-forward and incredibly fast process. 

You can try sending a few DJTX from the main [Dijets Wallet](https://wallet.dijets.io) to Decypher and then use the DJTX coins on Utility Chain to interact with EVM compatible services with ease.

To sign the DGC Manifesto, you need to have Decypher 3.0 installed on your computer and google chrome as an extension.

Once you have Decypher installed go to [DGC Manifesto](https://dijets.io/manifesto.html)

If you haven't done so already, make sure to select the option to "Set Decypher as my default wallet". This setting can be changed later within Decypher.
