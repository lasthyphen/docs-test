Hal applies impact estimations & priority markers to active governance proposals (DIPs). The goal of these markers is to provide DGC Members, 
with an idea of how important it is that they pay attention to a given governance proposal in a given limited time.

Depending upon the magnitude of impact a governance proposal may have on Dijets; HAL can assign: 

1. Low
1. Medium
1. High

priority markers to active proposals and governance activities. HAL uses the following guidelines when assigning the priority markers:

### Likely to be High Impact priority marker

* Anything that adds or removes a non-trivial amount of DJTX from the Treasury Wallet is likely to be marked as `high` impact.
* Anything that permanently changes any of the existing governance processes or structures is likely to be marked as `high` impact.
* Anything related to onboarding and offboarding sub-committee(s) is likely to be marked as `high` impact.
* Anything DGC Members collectively vote to accept and execute for the **first time** is likely to be marked as `high` impact.

### Likely to be Medium Impact priority marker

* Anything that adds or removes a trivial amount of money from the Treasury Wallet is likely to be marked as `medium` impact.
* Proposals that may lead to later decisions that add or remove a non-trivial amount of DJTX from the Treasury Wallet is likely to be marked as `medium` impact.

### Likely to be Low Impact priority marker

* Anything related to minor wording changes and/or fixes to existing DIPs are likely to be marked as `low` impact.
