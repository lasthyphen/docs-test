# What is DIP Framework:

Dijets Improvement Proposal Framework or DIP0 is the genesis dip that explains the DIPs framework.

[Dijets Improvement Proposal Framework (DIP0)](https://dips.dijets.io/dips/details/DIP0) defines the required framework that all DIPs must utilise and adhere to.

DIP0 is the genesis proposal describing the DIPs Framework. This includes the core modules, DIP statuses and types and the overall DIP lifecycle. 
Furthermore, DIP0 provides the necessary tools, such as DIP templates, replacement processes, and dependencies for authoring standardised improvement proposals.
DIP0 also details the key roles of the **DIP Editor** and **Governance Arbiter** within the framework.
