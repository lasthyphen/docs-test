## Reference Primitives

Reference Primitives are a series of DIPs presented as a sub-class of DIP Frameworks category that define or declare basic structure of a DIP Process or its facilitation.
A DIP marked as 'REF PRIM' is considered an informational/instructional DIP that has pre-emptively been accepted. Collectively Dijets Primitives
act as 'starting points' for a DIP process/feature/method that future DIPs can use as reference anchors.
These **Reference Primitives** have been designed to support the continuous expansion of Dijets Ecosystem and its increasing complexity as it matures over time.
