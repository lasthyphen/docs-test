# Member Incentives

HAL rewards classes of governance actions that result in measurable changes to the way Dijets operates.

### The Bounty Pool

An incentives pool per month is allocated for distribution amongst the DGC Members for successful submission of Dijets Governance proposals.

### LQ Tokens

LQ Tokens are the Likeability Quotient Tokens awarded and incentivised to council members for their participation and contribution to Dijets governance activities particularly the submission of DIP.

Members can convert the rewarded LQ tokens into DJT or any other token available or choose to sell it directly for cash.

### Eligible Proposal Types

Proposals eligible for rewards are:
* Successful DIP proposals
* Successful DIP Subproposals
* Blue DIP with majority consent via voting held on [Dijets Forum](https://forum.dijets.io)

A proposal is considered successful if its on-chain vote meets the success criteria defined in the accompanying on-chain poll text.

### Payout Cycle

Rewards are distributed at the start of each month, covering proposals that concluded in the previous month.

Payouts are consolidated into a CSV file and distributed by HAL from a multi-sig wallet.

HAL produces and publishes a memo each month communicating the initiatives and the members rewarded.

## Exclusions
**1.1** - Dijets Core Team may exclude a DGC Member from the rewards payouts at any time, for any reason.  

**1.2** - The Core Team must communicate a reason publicly if a given DGC Member is being excluded from the rewards payouts.
