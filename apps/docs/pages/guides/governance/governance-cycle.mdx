# DGC Monthly Governance Cycle

DGC is short for Dijets Governance Cycle.

DGC Monthly Governance Cycle explains the schedule for governance activities.

The Monthly Governance Cycle is defined in [DIP05](https://dips.dijets.io/dips/details/DIP5) and provides a predictable monthly cadence by which governance decisions can be made.

The Monthly Governance Cycle is predominantly used for the introduction of new DIPs or DIP subproposals into the [DIPs Directory](https://dips.dijets.io). Examples of such changes could include:

* The addition of a new Parameter in an existing DIP
* The adjustment of an existing process/paramter in an aalready accepted DIP

Proposals submitted into the Monthly Governance Cycle must follow the guidelines defined in [DIP0](https://dips.dijets.io/dips/details/DIP0).

## Governance Cycle Breakdown

The first Monday of each calendar month marks the beginning of Dijets Monthly Governance Cycle.

### Week 1

**Week 1, Monday through Wednesday**

- DGC Members acquire their monthly **_Collateralised Accountability Position_** or CAP.
- CAP can be procured by a DGC Member by locking min 1000 DJT as collateral to mint the equivalent amount of HAL tokens required to participate in Dijets Governance.
- At the end of the monthly governance cycle DGC members can redeem 1050 HAL Tokens for the originally locked 1000 DJT back. 
- The 50 additional HAL Tokens act as a superficial fee to close and settle their CAP positions. HAL Tokens can only be earned by participating in Dijets Governance.
- CAPs are designed to encourage accountability and positive contributions. Failing to return the required 1050 HAL Tokens may result in DGC Member's CAP position being liquidated with the 
collateralised 1000 DJT moving into HAL's incentive pool for other members to earn.

**Week 1, Thursday through Sunday**

- DGC Members submit their proposals to **Formal Submission**. The window lasts for 8 days.
- Proposals must be moved into the [Formal Submission](https://forum.dijets.io/c/dips/formal-submission/6) subcategory on Dijets forum under the [Dijets Improvement Proposals](https://forum.dijets.io/c/dips/5) category.
- DGC Members should inform a [DIP Editor](https://forum.dijets.io/g/DIP-Editors) of the status change via commonly used communication channels.

**Week 2, Sunday**
