How Dijets is different than Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?

When compared to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and other proof-of-work coins competing to replace fiat, Dijets might look like an entirely different species, but we actually have some things in common.

Dijets is a fixed cap asset, with a max of 100M DJT in circulation. It employs Satoshi’s UTXO model for single-use credentials to facilitate payments, rather than an account model. Finally, Dijets structures transactions like Segwit, without backward compatibility issues, and uses the Bech32 address format to minimise errors and maximise readability. (human readable part of an address reads "dijets")

Unlike Bitcoin, however, Dijets consensus is designed for speed, scalability, and flexibility in implementations.

Bitcoin achieves transaction finality in 1 hour. Dijets transactions achieve sub-second finality.

Bitcoin’s blockchain production is centered around 2 dozen mining pools and solo miners. Dijets can accommodate thousands to many millions of block producers without leaking value out of the system.

Bitcoin can facilitate ~5-7 transactions per second. Dijets has achieved 5,200 transactions per second, demonstrating that it can accommodate Visa level throughput.

Dijets uses a proof-of-stake model for network security, which is both environmentally friendly and doesn’t require the highly-specialised and extremely expansive mining rigs that have led to centralisation in mining. Meaning, thousands to even millions of individuals can fully participate in Dijets with just a computer and internet connection i.e Decentralisation.

Dijets was built on Bitcoin's founding principals and cherry picks some of its best features but it optimises the rest of the system for smart contracts and asset issuance bringing the best of both worlds into a single cryptocurrency.

How is Dijets different from Ethereum?

When compared to Ethereum, Dijets’s similarities are much more evident at the surface–after all, we do support the entirety of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its tooling–but under the hood, we approach our shared challenges in very different ways.

For now, Ethereum uses proof-of-work mining like Bitcoin and intends to migrate to proof-of-stake when it launches Ethereum 2.0. While proof-of-work is an excellent foundation for robust protocols, it achieves this stability by deliberately slowing down network actions and confirmations. A perfectly acceptable trade-off in Bitcoin’s “digital gold” thesis but a tough sell for the booming world of DeFi.

As long as Ethereum uses proof-of-work, it will struggle to scale participation without incurring massive fees and network congestion. Ethereum 2.0’s proof-of-stake approach will help, but it also introduces significant complexity and execution risk with its approach to scaling, “sharding”, which aims to process transactions simultaneously, rather than consecutively.

Dijets attacks the scaling challenge from the absolute foundation for decentralized networks, consensus. Protocols in the Dijets family are capable of achieving sub-second finality, supporting 4,500+ transactions per second, and scaling up to millions of full, block-producing validator nodes participating in consensus.

Unlike Ethereum, where applications have to compete for the same finite pool of network resources–which drives up fees for all participants–apps on Dijets can run in their own independent blockchains validated by a dynamic, custom set of validators, known as subnets. These subnets are still connected to the broader ecosystem of chains on Dijets, but now their relationships are purely value-adding (e.g. cross-network value transfer) rather than competitive.

Not only does this enable the creation of private subnets, it also allows developers to define the rules, economics, participants, and security of their implementation.

Similar to how we cherry-picked our favorite parts of Bitcoin, we’re implementing some of the amazing innovations of Ethereum and the EVM, while changing the core mechanics to make it faster, lighter, and cheaper to run.

#  How is Dijets different from the blockchains or “Ethereum Killers”?

What Ethereum has achieved is nothing short of incredible and we at Dijets wholly admire Ethereum's development efforts in smart contracts integration and the implementation of concepts like programmable money. Dijets was never built to compete or compare with Ethereum. Rather to follow in its footsteps and build decentralised technology for a better, safer and fairer future.

Projects that are fine with being labeled Ethereum Killers have gathered around a family of classical consensus protocols whose limits are well-understood and heavily researched over the last 40 years.

These projects are often the most outspoken about transaction throughput and speeds, and suspiciously quiet about their decentralization — as characterized by the number of participants a network can accommodate or reliance on nominated leaders — and the resultant security tradeoffs of small cohorts having so much control.

Unlike other blockchains or Ethereum Killers, Dijets achieves sub-second finality, high throughput, and efficiency without sacrificing its decentralisation and security.

Validators in Dijets conduct individual tests to determine which nodes to sample for a transaction's validity. Each node samples without any consideration to the selections made by other nodes. There is no preferential treatment or big conglomerates buying special seats to peer down on nodes of lesser privilege or stakes in Dijets.
