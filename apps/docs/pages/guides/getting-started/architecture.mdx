# The Chief Network

Dijets is a highly scalable, robust and decentralised network of heterogenous blockchains.
As opposed to most other networks, where
all applications reside in the same chain, Dijets network allows separate chains to be
created for different applications each to serve their individual purpose.

Dijets Chief Network is the central subnetwork that runs four different blockchains:

- The Value Chain - V-Chain
- The Utility Chain - U-Chain
- The Method Chain - M-Chain
- The Enterprise Consortia Chain - ECC

:::note
Dijets Mainnet is comprised of the Chief Network and all the Subnetworks deployed on it.
:::

A node can become a validator for Dijets Chief Network by staking a minimum of **5,000 DJTX**.

## The Chains

All validators of Dijets Chief Network are required to validate and secure the following:

### Utility Chain or U-Chain

Dijets Utility Chain or **U-Chain** is an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
The [U-Chain’s API](/docs/guides/node-apis/utility-chain-api.md) supports all of Geth's API methods and supports the
deployment and execution of smart contracts written in Solidity.

### Methhod Chain or M-Chain 

The Method Chain or **M-Chain** is responsible for all of Dijets Metadata computations.
The [M-Chain’s API](/docs/guides/node-apis/method-chain-api.md) supports the creation of new
blockchains and Subnetworks, the addition of validators to Subnetworks, staking operations, and most importantly
the collective intelligence database for its methods and natural language processing.

### Value Chain or V-Chain 

The Value Chain or **V-Chain** is responsible for operations on "Dijetal Assets" or Dijets
native tokens. A Dijetal Asset is essentially a representation of a real-world resource (for example, equity, or a
bond or a derivative) with sets of rules that govern its behavior, for example "Dijetal Asset B can’t be traded until 12pm Thursday."
The [V-Chain's API](/docs/guides/node-apis/value-chain-api.md) supports the creation and trading of
Dijetal assets aka its Native Tokens.

The key asset traded on the Value Chain is DJTX. When you issue a transaction to a blockchain on Dijets,
you pay a fee denominated in DJTX.

### Enterprise Consortia Chain or ECC

The Enterprise Consortia Chain or ECC differs from the other three chains in the automation and management of their blockchain validators. ECC is an instance of the enterprise grade blockchain which allows organisations to launch fully managed, custom blockchains in a matter of minutes.
